## come up with what we need to check...
  ## number of SNPs
    ## > 250k and < X amount (what would we expect to see if we want to send warning to check that data is not imputed)
  ## duplicate SNPs
  ## check fam file for duplicate individuals
  ## since these plink files are only used as input for plink we shouldn't really have to check much and they should be compatible?
